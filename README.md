# Free GenAI Bootcamp 2025 - Project: Language Learning Platform

## 👋 Introduction

Hi! I'm a participant in the Free GenAI Cloud Project Bootcamp, and this is my project repository. Over the next 6 weeks, I'll be building an AI-powered language learning platform as part of my journey to learn GenAI development.

## 🎯 Project Goal

I've been assigned the role of an AI Engineer for a Language Learning School. My main tasks are to:
- Build various AI-powered learning applications
- Help maintain the school's learning portal using AI tools
- Work on extending the platform to support multiple languages

## 📚 What I'll Be Learning

Through this project, I'm aiming to learn:
- How to work with different types of AI models (both API-based and self-hosted)
- Building practical AI applications for education
- Implementing AI safety and guardrails
- Working with caching and optimization
- Creating user-friendly AI interfaces

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

I'll be implementing a system with these main components:

### Teacher Tools
- AI-powered quiz generation
- Automated grading system
- AI-assisted lesson planning

### Student Activities
- Interactive writing practice
- Text-based adventure games
- Novel reading assistance
- Sentence construction exercises
- Visual flashcards
- Speaking practice

### Technical Components
- Model Layer (using GPT-4, Claude, and open-source models)
- Query Processing
- Caching System
- Learning Analytics

## 📝 Weekly Learning Goals

1. **Pre-Week 1**: Understanding and designing the architecture and setting up the first project module - Sentence Constructor
2. **Week 1**: 
3. **Week 3**: 
4. **Week 4**: 
5. **Week 5**: 
6. **Week 6**: 

## 🛠️ Technologies I'll Be Using

- AI/ML: GPT-4, Claude, and open-source LLMs
- Backend: Python
- Frontend: React
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Caching: Redis
- Vector Search for efficient content retrieval

## 📊 Key Features I Plan to Implement

- Query processing with RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Input and output safety guardrails
- Caching for better performance
- Progress tracking and analytics
- Multi-language support

## 🎓 Learning Resources

- GenAI Bootcamp materials - https://www.youtube.com/@ExamProChannel
- Architecture diagrams and documentation
- Community support
- Online AI/ML resources

## 🤝 Acknowledgments

Special thanks to:
- The GenAI Bootcamp team for providing this learning opportunity
- The open-source community for their tools and resources
- Fellow bootcamp participants for their support

## 📌 Notes

This is a learning project as part of the Free GenAI Cloud Project Bootcamp. I'll be updating this repository as I progress through the bootcamp and learn more about GenAI development.
