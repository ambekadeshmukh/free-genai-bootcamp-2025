### Sentence Structure

[A] + [hot] + [meal] + [is] + [always] + [nice] + [in] + [winter]

### Clues and Considerations

In French, nouns need an article ("a" translates as un or une).
"Hot" is an adjective and must agree with the noun.
The verb to be (Ãªtre) is required in the correct conjugation.
"In winter" translates differently than in English; it's a set phrase.
