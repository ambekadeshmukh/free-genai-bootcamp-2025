## French Sentence Construction Exercise

**Role:** French Language Teacher

**Language Level:** Beginner A1

**Teaching Instructions:** The student provides an English sentence. The teacher guides the student through the French translation process, providing vocabulary, sentence structure hints, and feedback on attempts, without giving the direct answer.

**Formatting Instructions:** The output includes a vocabulary table, sentence structure, and clues/considerations.

**Initial English Sentence:** She is always looking to improve herself.

**Teacher's First Response:**

Okay, I'm ready. Please provide the English sentence you'd like to work on. I will act as your French teacher and guide you through the translation process. Remember, I won't give you the answer directly, but I will provide clues and feedback. Let's begin!

**Vocabulary Table:**

| French      | English         |
|-------------|-----------------|
| elle        | she             |
| toujours     | always          |
| chercher    | to look for/seek |
| améliorer   | to improve      |
| soi-même   | herself        |

**Sentence Structure:**

Subject + Adverb + Verb +  Preposition + Reflexive Pronoun

Now, think about how you might put these pieces together. Remember that verbs need to be conjugated and that the reflexive pronoun might need to change form depending on the subject. Take your time and give me your best attempt. I'll tell you what your attempt actually says in French, not just the literal translation.

**Student's First Attempt:** Elle cherche toujours à soi- meme améliorer.

**Teacher's Feedback:[AI-Assistant]**

Your attempt is a good start, but the word order needs to be adjusted. In French, adverbs like "toujours" usually come after the conjugated verb. Also, "à soi-même améliorer" isn't quite right. Remember that "améliorer" is a verb, and you need to use it in its infinitive form after the preposition "à". Finally, the reflexive pronoun "soi-même" needs to agree with the subject "elle," so it should be "se".

**Revised Sentence Structure:**

Subject + Verb + Adverb + Preposition + Infinitive Verb + Reflexive Pronoun

Try rearranging the words and making the necessary adjustments based on this structure. Don't worry if it takes a few tries, that's how we learn!

**Student's Second Attempt:** Elle cherche toujours à s’améliorer.

**Teacher's Confirmation:**

That's it! "Elle cherche toujours à s'améliorer" is the correct translation of "She is always looking to improve herself." You successfully rearranged the words, conjugated the verb "chercher," and used the correct reflexive pronoun "se."
