### Sentence Structure
[article] [adjective] [noun] [verb be] [adverb] [adjective] [preposition] [article] [noun]

### Clues and Considerations
- In French, adjectives typically come after the noun they describe
- Consider which articles (un/une/le/la/les) you'll need
- The season will need a preposition "en" before it
- Remember that "is" needs to be conjugated in present tense

## Student's Response
"Un repas chaud est toujours agréable en hiver."

## Teacher's Analysis [ AI- Asssitant]
The translation is correct. The student successfully:
- Placed the adjective "chaud" after the noun "repas"
- Used the correct masculine article "un"
- Conjugated "être" (est) correctly
- Used "en" before "hiver"

Note: Student used "agréable" (pleasant/nice) which wasn't in the vocabulary list, but it's perfectly correct and natural in this context.
