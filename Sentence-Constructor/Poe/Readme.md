# Poe Assistant Guide

Poe.com is a platform developed by Quora that allows users to chat with various AI models, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude, and other AI models. It provides a single interface where users can interact with different AI assistants, compare their responses, and explore different conversational AI capabilities.

Poe (short for "Platform for Open Exploration") also enables users to create their own AI bots using prompts and APIs, making it a useful tool for experimenting with AI applications.
