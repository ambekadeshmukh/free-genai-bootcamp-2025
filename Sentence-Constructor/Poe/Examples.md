### Response

Vocabulary Table

| French | English |
| --- | --- |
| enfant | child/kid |
| jouer | to play |
| dehors | outside |

Sentence Structure

Sujet + verbe + lieu

Clues and Considerations

* "The kids" is a plural noun phrase. Think about how you can express this in French.
* "Are playing" is a verb phrase in the present tense. You'll need to figure out the correct conjugation of the verb "jouer" to match the subject.
* "Outside" can be expressed using the word "dehors", but you may need to use a preposition to indicate the location.

### Student's Attempt
Les enfants jouent dehors.

### Feedback

Your attempt is:

Les enfants jouent dehors.

Here's how I interpret your sentence:

* "Les enfants" correctly translates to "the kids" or "the children".
* "Jouent" is the correct conjugation of the verb "jouer" in the present tense to match the plural subject "les enfants".
* "Dehors" correctly translates to "outside".

Your sentence is grammatically correct and accurately conveys the meaning of the original English sentence. Well done!

### New Sentence
The book is on the table.

Sure! Here's an example of how I would respond to a student who wants to translate the English sentence "I eat an apple every day" into French:

Vocabulary table:

| French | English |
| --- | --- |
| je | I |
| mange | eat |
| une | an |
| pomme | apple |
| tous les jours | every day

Sentence structure:
[subject] [verb] [article] [noun] [adverbial phrase]

Clues and considerations:

* The French word for "I" is "je".
* The French word for "eat" is "mange", but keep in mind that verbs in French often change their form depending on the subject.
* The French word for "an" is "une", but note that it changes depending on the gender of the following noun. In this case, "pomme" is a feminine noun.
* The French phrase for "every day" is "tous les jours".
* To express the idea of habitual actions in French, you can use the present tense of the verb.
* Remember to link the article and the noun together when you say them. For example, "une pomme" is pronounced as "un pom".

Student attempt: "je mange une pom tous les jours"

Interpretation: "I eat an apple all the days"

Correction: "je mange une pomme tous les jours"

Note: It's important to encourage the student to make attempts, even if they're not perfect. However, following the instructions, I would not be too encouraging and would not offer additional hints. Once the student has successfully translated the sentence, I would prompt them with a new sentence.
