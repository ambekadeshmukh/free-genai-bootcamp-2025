# Project 1 - Sentence Constructor

## French Sentence Constructor ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

This is the first project of the GenAI Cloud Project Bootcamp to help students learn French in a more interactive way. 

## Goal of the Project

The goal of the project is to see how well the different AI assistant models respond to the prompts , and are they following the instructions , their speed, feedback style, accuracy and vocabulary.

## What's This All About?

Ever tried learning a new language and wished you had a friendly guide available 24/7? That's exactly what this project aims to be! Instead of just giving you translations, this AI teaching assistant helps you figure out how to construct French sentences on your own.

Think of it as having a patient tutor who gives you hints and guides you through the process, rather than just giving you the answers.

## Why this project ?

This project was inspired by a real-world scenario: a language school wanting to help their students practice between classes. The goal is to make learning French more engaging and accessible, while ensuring students actually learn rather than just getting quick translations.

## How It Works

The AI assistant:

- Guides you through translating English sentences to French
- Gives helpful hints when you're stuck
- Explains grammar concepts as needed
- Keeps the focus on learning, not just translating

## Findings and Summary

Exploring questions like:

How well can AI handle being a teaching assistant?
Should we use one AI for everything or split tasks between specialized assistants?
What's the best way to move from prototype to a real product?
